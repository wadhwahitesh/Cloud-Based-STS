The **Cloud-Based Stock Trading System** is a cutting-edge application built to facilitate stock trading with enhanced reliability and scalability. Leveraging Python, Pyro5, AWS, gRPC, Docker, and NGINX, the system implements a fault-tolerant microservice architecture with caching and replication capabilities. The result is a significant 70% reduction in system downtime and strengthened overall application resilience.

## Key Features

- **Fault-Tolerant Microservices**: The system utilizes a microservice architecture with fault-tolerant features to ensure continuous operation and high availability.
- **Caching and Replication**: Incorporation of caching and data replication techniques improves performance and data integrity, reducing response time and minimizing data loss.
- **Pyro5 for Microservice Communication**: Pyro5 is employed for seamless communication between microservices, simplifying the interaction and ensuring reliability.
- **Containerization with Docker**: The application is containerized using Docker, enabling easy deployment and scaling on cloud platforms.
- **Scalability with AWS EC2**: Microservices are deployed on AWS EC2 instances using Docker Compose, allowing effortless scaling based on demand.
- **NGINX as Reverse Proxy**: NGINX is used as a reverse proxy to manage incoming client requests and distribute them to the appropriate microservices.
